create a new bucket called num to store whole number
create a new bucket called i to store whole number
create a bucket called cnum to store whole number
create a new bucket called digit to store whole number
create a new bucket called sum to store whole number

Ask to input a whole number with a message 'Enter number' and store it in num
assign the value of 0 to i
assign the value of num to cnum
assign the value of 0 to sum

run till cnum more_than 0
  Calculate the value of cnum%10 and store it in digit
  Calculate the value of sum*10 and store it in sum
  Calculate the value of digit+sum and store it in sum
  Calculate the value of cnum/10 and store it in cnum.

if sum equals num
  print 'It is a palindrome number'.
else
  print 'It is not a palindrome number'
